# Regex Tutorial: Hex Value

## Description
Developers write code, but they also *write about code*. Take a moment to search the web for tutorials about any of the subjects you’ve learned so far in this course. You’re likely to find thousands of tutorials written by developers of all skill levels, including junior developers&mdash;like yourself!

Your assignment this week is to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. You'll use the template provided in the starter code to create your walkthrough.

### User Story
AS A web development student I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines

## Summary
This gist topic is about describing the Hex Value: `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`.  The hex value will be broken down into its anchors, quanitifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, charecter classes, or operators, flags, and character escapes and will have accompanying descriptions.  

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
